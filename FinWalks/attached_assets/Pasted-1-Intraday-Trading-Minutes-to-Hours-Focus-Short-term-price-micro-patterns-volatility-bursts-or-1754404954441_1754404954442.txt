HAR-RV: uses realized vol at different horizons.

EGARCH: captures asymmetric volatility.

How these are combined (hedge fund style)
Generate signals from multiple models.

Use HMM/regime filters to activate correct models.

Combine scores into one final confidence (ensemble).

Size trades with Kelly, control risk with EVT.
