✅ 1. Statistical Arbitrage (StatArb) & Cointegration
Used in pair trading and mean-reverting strategies:

Z-score for mean reversion:

𝑍
=
(
𝑋
−
𝜇
)
𝜎
Z= 
σ
(X−μ)
​
 
Where 
𝑋
X is the current spread, 
𝜇
μ mean, 
𝜎
σ standard deviation.

Cointegration test (Engle-Granger or Johansen):
Models two or more time series that share a long-term relationship.

✅ 2. Machine Learning-Based Prediction
Modern quant firms use models such as:

Random Forest / Gradient Boosting Trees

Deep Learning (LSTM, Transformer models)

Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning, PPO)

Autoencoders for market state detection

Clustering + Regime Switching

These models use technical/fundamental indicators as features.

✅ 3. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) — For regime detection
Used to model market states (bull/bear, high/low volatility):

𝑃

✅ 5. Kelly Criterion (Optimal Position Sizing)
𝑓

=

𝑝
−
𝑞
𝑏
f 
∗
 = 
b
bp−q
​
 
Where:

𝑓
∗
f 
∗
  = fraction of capital to bet

𝑏
b = odds received

𝑝
p = probability of winning

𝑞
=
1
−
𝑝
q=1−p

✅ 6. Bayesian Regime Switching Models
Bayesian inference to determine probability of being in a market regime (e.g., uptrend, sideways, crash).

𝑃

𝜃

𝑋
)
=
𝑃
(

P(θ∣X)=

P(X∣θ)P(θ)
​
 
✅ 7. EVT (Extreme Value Theory) — Tail Risk Management
Used to model rare events and fat tails:

Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) for threshold exceedances

✅ 8. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Used in yield curve modeling, factor analysis, dimensionality reduction:

𝑍

𝑋
⋅
𝑊
Z=X⋅W
✅ 9. Alpha Combination & Weighting
